        // translations in part 2 to be a bit confusing at times, and some 
        // instructions seemed a little vague (the dungeon game exercise in 
        // particular had a failed test case where I couldn't figure out what 
        // the intended behavior was). I'm also not confident in my 
        //understanding of things like when to implement interfaces vs extending 
        // classes, and my understanding of abstract classes is also a little 
        // fuzzy.
